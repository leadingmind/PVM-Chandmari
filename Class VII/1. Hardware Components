  e)What are the different types of secondary storage devices?
  Ans: There are three primary categories for secondary storage devices:- 
     1.Magnetic storage 
     2.Optical storage 
     3.Solid state storage
     
5. Answer the following questions in detail.
  a)List the four major operations performed by a computer.
  Ans: The four major operations performed by a computer are:-
     1. it accepts data or instructions as input
     2. it stores data and instructions
     3. it processes data as per the instructions
     4. it gives results inthe form of output.
     
  b)Describe the motherboard.
  Ans: The motherboard is a printed circuit board which holds the essential parts 
    of the computer and maintains the communication between all parts.
       Printed circuit boardnis a board made up of a non-conducting material such 
    as plastic or fiber glass. Electronic components are attached to this board 
    using a matel to conduct electricity.
    
  c)Compare the working procedure of a mouse and a trackball.
  Ans: An optical mouse has a tiny camera that takes more than a thousand pictures 
    per second. An optical sensor and a signal processor analyses each picture and 
    based on the changes, the mouse cursor moves on the screen.
       The trackball consists of a ball held by a socket. The socket contains sensors 
       to detect the rotation of the ball. The user rolls the ball to direct the 
       cursor to the desired place on the screen.
  d)Explain the working of the CPU.
  Ans: Every CPU performs performs 3 basic operations:-
    1. Fetch: In this step CPU reads instruction that is to be operated from a particular address in memory.
    2. Decode: In this step CPU decodes all the instructions fetched from the memory.
    3. Execute: In the last step CPU executes the instruction.
  e)Differentiate between primary memory and secondary memory.
  Ans: 
          Primary Memory          |             Secondary memory
   _______________________________|__________________________________________
   1. Primary memory devices are  |1. Secondary memory devices are magnetic, 
      semiconductor memories      |   optical and electronic memories
   2. Primary memory can be       |2. Secondary memory is always 
      volatile as well as         |   non-volatile
      non-volatile.               |
   3. Primary memory is more      |3. Secondary memory is somewhat slower 
      effective and interacts     |   in interacting with the microprocessor 
      more quickly with the       |   than primary memory
